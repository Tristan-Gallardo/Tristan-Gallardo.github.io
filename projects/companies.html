										<h1>Company Project</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The first ever professional project that I did was during an internship at Continental as an embedded software developer.</p>
									
									<p>The problem was simple, previously, they had an analyzer of EEPROM/flash dumps called "FEE Dump Analyzer" that simplified the development of their projects, but over time, the software had become too old, and worse, the original source was lost.</p>
									
									<p>
										The outcome, a rebuilt analyzer from the ground up using Python, managing to display each bank/block from FEE and FAFEE files, inform if they contained errors, show the latest version of each block, and more.<br/>
										It's even more modern with the addition of compatibility and better UI (for example: the FEE part no longer worked on the basis of three banks but N-banks and the output contained CSS instead of only pure HTML).
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Thanks to the previous HTML output of the old application as example, I was the sole developer who rebuilt it, designing the new system architecture and implementing all features.<br/>
										While progressing, my supervisor was so impressed by my speed, to the point that I was able to add supplementary functionalities.
									</p>

									<p>I used Python, File I/O, HTML/CSS generation, Data Parsing.</p>

										<h1>So what?</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In the end, the application was so well made that they decided together to keep a space specially for me when I would return for my work-study program, and later, during my vacation, I would also learn that they had switched projects, and that the program still worked on the new FEE structure with 4 banks.</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="../images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The second project that I'm currently doing is, if you guessed it, in the same company, this time as an AI developer, where I was asked majorly to create plugins for their AI platform, which in return means a lot more clients than the previous project.</p>
									<p>The first one that I did was for Excel, so that instead of calling one by one each cell to generate/translate/formulate, they would simply have a user-defined function or an interface to select them directly in batch.</p>
									<p>Throughout the development, the biggest challenge was simply the coding language, VBA7.0, as it is very old, with the userform still using the Windows 95 display.</p>
									<p>But this didn't stop me; I even added automatic updates, good-looking interfaces, and a lot of security measures.</p>
									<p>However, since it was my first plugin, I also had to create the API calls on Python and the website to download the plugins.</p>
									<p>Finally, with the application done, the teaser was out on their platform, and I will soon get the next project to do.</p>
