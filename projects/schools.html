										<h1>Schools Projects</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="../images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>My real first project was in my first year of BUT in computer science.<br/>
									<p>Indeed, we were asked, as a team of three, to develop in two months a resolver of Hashi in Ada, and if you don't know what a Hashi is, it's a Japanese puzzle with simple rules: On a grid are located multiple islands, each having their own number, and the objective is to link them with the correct amount of bridges, but we can only link them with one or two bridges maximum.</p>
									<p>Throughout the development, everything was going well, managing to create the classes of the grid, the island, and more, even though the difficulties we may have encountered.</p>
									<p>But one was more complicated than the others, the "resolver" part; no one on the team was capable of creating a program that could resolve more than one Hashi, and with only one day left, it was only a matter of time.</p>
									<p>But being a perfectionist and determined, I didn't want to send an unfinished project, and so, throughout the night before D-Day, I coded and coded, giving myself multiple false hopes during each test, but eventually, I did it; I created not only a resolver, but one using a backtracking structure instead of a recursive one. And so, happy with my results, I sent it and went to sleep, without knowing that I was the only one who had used the backtracking structure, and the day after, a friend told me that my team was first in the standings.</p>
									<p>This project, even though it looks simple, really showed me what I was capable of and encouraged me to continue along this path and to pursue my studies.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="../images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The second project that also had a big impact on me was in my second year of BUT.</p>
									<p>This time, we were asked, in a team of four, to develop a property management application in Java, and compared to the precedent, it was much longer as it lasted the entire year.</p>
									<p>Though the project was less stressful due to the amount of time we were given, some challenges were still present, with the client asking something new that we didn't quite understand, or bugs happening right before the presentations.</p>
									<p>But still, there was more freedom that came with it, and a more friendly cooperation thanks to the given time.</p>
									<p>What really showed my capabilities though was when the code became more complex. </p>
									<p>Indeed, because of the number of functionalities, the code started to become less and less readable, and since I always want to keep my functions as understandable as they can be, this startled me when my team asked what each other had written.</p>
									<p>So to compensate, I started doing my procedures at a much lower level and did some abstraction to simplify things, and to my surprise, it actually worked.</p>
									<p>They were using the functions that I had made to simplify each part of their code, with even one thinking that it was part of the base class and not an abstraction added by myself.</p>
									<p>This project showed me that my coding skills could be useful not only to the clients, but also to my team, and that doing so can accelerate the work for today, as well as tomorrow.</p>
