										<h1>Schools Projects</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My real first project was in my first year of BUT in computer science.</p>
									
									<p>The problem is that we needed to develop a fully functional Hashi puzzle solver in Ada within two months. The challenge was to implement logic that could automatically solve any given puzzle, but we were stuck, only resolving the first simpliest puzzle, and there was only one day left.</p>

									<p>But still, we succeded, delivering a complete solver capable of handling multiple puzzles, and since we were the only one who implemented a backtracking structure instead of a recursive one, we reached first in the class ranking.</p>

									<p>It was simply because I took full responsibility in developing the resolving part, designing and implementing all night before the submission deadline and succeding, without even knowing that I was the only one who implemented a backtracking structure.</p>

									<p>For the tech, I used, like I said, Ada, Backtracking Algorithm and Object-Oriented Design.</p>

										<h1>So what?</h1>
									</header>
									<p>This project, even though it looks simple, really showed me what I was capable of and encouraged me to continue along this path and to pursue my studies.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./images/pic11.jpg" alt=""></span>
									<p>The second project that also had a big impact on me was in my second year of BUT.</p>
									<p>This time, we were asked, in a team of four, to develop a property management application in Java, and compared to the precedent, it was much longer as it lasted the entire year.</p>
									<p>Though the project was less stressful due to the amount of time we were given, some challenges were still present, with the client asking something new that we didn't quite understand, or bugs happening right before the presentations.</p>
									<p>But still, there was more freedom that came with it, and a more friendly cooperation thanks to the given time.</p>
									<p>What really showed my capabilities though was when the code became more complex. </p>
									<p>Indeed, because of the number of functionalities, the code started to become less and less readable, and since I always want to keep my functions as understandable as they can be, this startled me when my team asked what each other had written.</p>
									<p>So to compensate, I started doing my procedures at a much lower level and did some abstraction to simplify things, and to my surprise, it actually worked.</p>
									<p>They were using the functions that I had made to simplify each part of their code, with even one thinking that it was part of the base class and not an abstraction added by myself.</p>
									<p>This project showed me that my coding skills could be useful not only to the clients, but also to my team, and that doing so can accelerate the work for today, as well as tomorrow.</p>
